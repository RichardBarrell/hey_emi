This is a very simple app. You type some text in the box at the
bottom, and it displays it really big. It's for using your phone like
a pen and paper, to tell people things when you can't speak with your
voice.

The slider at the bottom controls the size of the text. Pull it left
to make the text smaller. Pull it right to make the text bigger.
